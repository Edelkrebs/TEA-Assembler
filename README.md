# TEA-Assembler
A 6502 Assembler written in C.

# Features
I am planning on making the Assembler support modern things such as if statements or structs, but for now it is only a 6502 Assembler I am working on.

# Current features
- Able to assemble the entire 6502 instruction set with all default addressing modes.

# Work in progress:
- Labels
- Directive system
- .BYTE / .WORD directives
- Org directive
- Other higher level directives
